# Configuration

On the first run, a config file will be created in your config directory, typically it is at`~/.config/waypaper/config.ini` Here is a typical config:

```
[Settings]
language = en
folder = ~/Pictures
wallpaper = ~/Pictures/wallpaper.jpg
backend = swaybg
monitors = All
fill = Fill
sort = name
color = #ffffff
subfolders = False
all_subfolders = False
show_hidden = False
show_gifs_only = False
show_path_in_tooltip = True
number_of_columns = 3
use_xdg_state = False
zen_mode = False
swww_transition_type = any
swww_transition_step = 90
swww_transition_angle = 0
swww_transition_duration = 2
swww_transition_fps = 60
mpvpaper_sound = False
mpvpaper_options = 
post_command = 
```

Most of the options in the config are controlled by the GUI application, and the user is not expected to change them manually. However, some advanced parameter can be set only in config:

### Folders

To use wallpapers from multiple folders, the folder paths will need to be placed in the config explicitly and will be overwritten if changed in the GUI. To use wallpaper from multiple folders, put folders separated line by line.

```
folder = /path/folder_1
         /path/folder_2
         /path/folder_3
```

### Running scripts after setting wallpaper

`post_command` option can be used to automatically run a command after selecting a wallpaper. This option supports `$wallpaper` parameter, so you can write something like:

```
post_command = echo "My new wallpaper: $wallpaper "
```

or you can run your own script there as:

```
post_command = my_wallpaper_script.sh $wallpaper
```

### Language

The `language` parameter can be set to one of the following: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `ru`, `pl`, `zh`, `zh_HK`.

### State file

`use_xdg_state` parameter is useful when you want to use a state file instead of a traditional config file. The state file will be then saved separately in a state directory and contain state parameters like wallpapers and monitors. Useful for systems with immutable configs.

### Video options

`mpvpaper_options` can contain some setting for the video wallpaper is you uses _mpvpaper_ backend. For example, you can specify something like:

```
mpvpaper_options = profile=fast --vf-add=fps=3:round=near
```
